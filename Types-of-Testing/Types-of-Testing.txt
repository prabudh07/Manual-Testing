DAY 2: TYPES OF TESTING (Manual Testing)
PART 1: Testing Classifications in Manual Testing
1. Based on Execution:
Type	Description
Manual Testing	Human tester executes test cases without automation. Used in most real-world scenarios initially.
Automation Testing	Uses tools (like Selenium, Cypress, etc.) to automate tests. Focus of later stages in your career.

2. Based on Code Knowledge:
Type	Description
Black Box Testing	Tester doesn’t know internal code. Focuses only on inputs & outputs. (Manual testers mostly do this.)
White Box Testing	Code-level testing done by developers or automation engineers (e.g., unit testing).
Grey Box Testing	Tester has limited knowledge of code or architecture. Helpful in integration testing.

 PART 2: Functional Testing – (Tests What the system does)
Functional testing checks features and business logic. You’ll use this most in Manual QA.
All Functional Testing Types:
Test Type	Purpose	Real-World Example
Smoke Testing	Basic checks to verify if the app is stable enough for further testing	App login loads correctly after deployment
Sanity Testing	Narrow checks after bug fix to confirm specific functionality	“Forgot password” feature works after fix
Regression Testing	Ensures old functionalities still work after a change	Test full checkout flow after adding a new payment method
Re-testing	Re-running failed test cases after defects are fixed	Bug in signup page re-tested after developer patch
Integration Testing	Test how multiple components/modules work together	Cart and payment modules interacting properly
System Testing	Full end-to-end test of the entire application	A complete user journey: Sign up → Search → Buy item
UAT (User Acceptance Testing)	Testing done by client or end-users before going live	Client uses the system in real scenarios to approve it
Interface Testing	Verifies communication between systems (APIs, databases, etc.)	Payment gateway connects correctly with bank API
Accessibility Testing	Ensures app is usable by disabled users	Screen reader works for visually impaired users

 PART 3: Non-Functional Testing – (How the system works)
 All Non-Functional Testing Types:
Test Type	Purpose	Real-World Example
Performance Testing	Checks speed, stability, and responsiveness	App loads in <2 seconds under load
Load Testing	Tests system under expected number of users	500 users accessing login at once
Stress Testing	Tests system beyond normal capacity	App under 2000 users crashes gracefully
Scalability Testing	Check how well the system can scale with traffic	Increase users from 100 to 10,000
Usability Testing	Evaluates user experience and ease of use	New users can finish sign-up within 1 min
Security Testing	Finds vulnerabilities and checks data protection	App doesn’t allow SQL injection
Compatibility Testing	Ensures app works on all browsers/devices/OS	iPhone Safari & Android Chrome both supported
Reliability Testing	App runs stable under continuous use	App runs 12 hours with no crash or memory leak
Maintainability Testing	How easy it is to fix or update the app	Developer updates version in 1 hour
Compliance Testing	Checks if the app follows legal/industry standards	App follows GDPR data protection norms
